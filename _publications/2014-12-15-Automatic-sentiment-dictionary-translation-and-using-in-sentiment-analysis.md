People want to decide in their daily and seasonal activities by referring other people's emotions, experiences or opinions. This tendency also means transfer of experience and expansion of communal memory. For instance, making a decision about a product or service to buy, a movie to watch or a candidate to elect can be counted in this manner. Other people's opinions on a particular subject is usually important and there is a necessity of having conversation with that person or reading his her writings to learn it. On the other hand, accessing to writings is relatively easier. Moreover, accessing to massive content of crowds has become much more easier via todays web applications and social media. However, as the volume of this content rises, extraction and assessment of focused content becomes impossible by human effort in plausible time. Thus, this point particularly constitutes the main motivation of sentiment analysis besides content retrieval systems, text mining and natural language processing.
