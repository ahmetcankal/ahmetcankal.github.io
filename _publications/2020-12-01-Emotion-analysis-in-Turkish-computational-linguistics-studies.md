Computational linguistics is an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the verbal or written language, to express it mathematically and suggest methods, models and tools to achieve these goals. Emotion analysis, a research area of computational linguistics; is the process of finding which feelings taking place in what proportion in sound, image or text data. The developments such as the proliferation of the Internet, the increase of digital content, the increase of storage and computing power have both paved the way for automatic emotion analysis and made emotion analysis an important need. This study, which summarizes the subject of emotion analysis, aims to explain the history and importance of emotion analysis from a linguistic perspective, and briefly introduce the current application areas of emotion analysis.
