I'm Dr. Alaettin UÇAN.

I did my postgraduate education at Hacettepe University Computer Engineering Department. The subject of my doctoral dissertation, which I defended in 2020, is the "Use of Optimization and Pretrained Language models in Emotion Analysis".

My main research topics are Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Optimization. 

I took part in academic projects supported by TUBITAK and commercial projects for several institutions such as " TAF General Staff", "Ministry of Health", "Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey" and "Ford Turkey".

Please contact me for academic and commercial collaborations.
